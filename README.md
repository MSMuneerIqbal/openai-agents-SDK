# OpenAI Agents Collection

Welcome to my repository where I am building and sharing multiple **OpenAI Agents** using the **OpenAI Agent SDK**.  
Each project here is powered by **OpenAI Agent SDK** and managed with **uv** for modern and efficient Python package management.

---

## What is this Repository?

This repository is a collection of different **OpenAI Agents** designed for various tasks like chatting, automations, assistants, and more.  
Each agent is built using the **OpenAI Agent SDK**, following best practices for structure, environment management, and deployment.

## What is OpenAI Agent SDK?

The **OpenAI Agent SDK** enables developers to easily build, manage, and deploy AI-powered agents that can plan, reason, and take actions.  
It provides a robust framework to create intelligent workflows with memory, tools, and instructions.

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **OpenAI Agent SDK** (for agent building)
- **uv** (for environment and dependency management)
- **dotenv** (for secure environment variables)
- **OpenAI / Gemini / Other LLMs** (for model backend)

---

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

---

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (using uv)

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate    # For Linux / MacOS
.venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Add Environment Variables

Each project might require a `.env` file with API keys or configurations. Example:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

---

##  Repository Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ agent_project_1/    # First agent project
â”œâ”€â”€ agent_project_2/    # Second agent project
â”œâ”€â”€ common/             # (Optional) Common utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Dependencies
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml      # uv project config
```

Each agent will have its own folder with a clear structure.

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- uv installed (`pip install uv`)
- API Keys (OpenAI, Gemini, or other providers depending on the agent)

---

##  Notes

- **uv** ensures faster installs and cleaner environments.
- Each agent is isolated and uses its own models, instructions, and sometimes tools.
- The projects are focused on learning, experimenting, and deploying AI Agents professionally.

##  License

This repository is open-source and free to use.  
Feel free to explore, contribute, and build on top of these agents!
